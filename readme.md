# Seattle Restaurant StoryMap

An interactive geo‑narrative exploring my favorite restaurants in Seattle. Built with Mapbox GL JS and Scrollama for the UW Geography Lab 07.

I used AI in this assignment for debugging as it kept saying my mapbox token was exposed and did not let me upload files. I did not use AI to write or complete any components where AI use is prohibited. If AI was used for debugging or development, I am able to explain the relevant code and decisions.
